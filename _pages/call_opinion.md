## Call for Opinions – We Want to Hear From You!

We invite submissions to our Call for Opinions track. What is the field of probabilistic inference and generative modelling getting right? What is it getting wrong? What emerging topics deserve greater attention — or perhaps less? Share your perspective with the community!

Here are a few illustrative examples:
- Missing or inadequate benchmarks / evaluations in probabilistic and generative modelling
- Overlooked connections between probabilistic inference and natural or social sciences
- Gaps between theoretical advances and practical applications
- Open questions that deserve more focus — or questions that may not need to be addressed 

We are framing this as a friendly competition: three selected winners will each receive a amazon gift card prize! 
<!-- (500GBP/200GBP/100GBP? ---need to comfirm) -->

We encourage submissions of at least one page, clearly describing your key insights, concerns, or proposals for future directions. There is no hard page limit for this track, but we highly suggestion a compact and concise discussion. Submissions should be made through the following [Google Form link] (link to be inserted), and do not need to be anonymised.
